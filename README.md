## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "I want to buil an application that allows you to record, edit, and publish a podcast. It should allow you to have multiple people access the site from their own computers to be a part of the recording so that you can have multiple participants in the podcast. The editing should allow you to cut out clips and mix with the sound and then publishing should show the podcast and notes and an image for the podcast episode."

### Code Generation Prompt

> Based on the content model I created for "I want to buil an application that allows you to record, edit, and publish a podcast. It should allow you to have multiple people access the site from their own computers to be a part of the recording so that you can have multiple participants in the podcast. The editing should allow you to cut out clips and mix with the sound and then publishing should show the podcast and notes and an image for the podcast episode.", now build a complete web application that showcases this content.
